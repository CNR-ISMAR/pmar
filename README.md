# PMAR - Pressure assessment for MARine activities

**PMAR** is a software package for modelling environmental **pressures** from **human activities** at sea. 

**Pressures** considered here are substances which act as tracers and cause negative impacts when released in the marine environment. This may include marine litter, oil or other hazardous substances, non-indigenous species, microbial pathogens, organic matter, etc.

**Human activities** at sea such as maritime transport, fishing, oil & gas activities, etc., may cause the release of such substances, thus becoming pressure **sources**. 

PMAR is open source and is programmed in python. Particle trajectories are modelled using [OpenDrift](https://opendrift.github.io/). PMAR is so far only optimised to work on the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins.
